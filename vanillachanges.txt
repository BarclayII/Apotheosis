Music note spells only hit every 15 frames instead of every 1 frame
Circle of Vigour & Healing Bolt can not be copied by greek spells (perk to make the uncopyable copyable? Spell Master?)
Some spells have had their mana cost drastically reduced to become competitive with other spells again
Bubbly Bounce no longer does self damage
Projectile Repulsion Field is removed and replaced with Oversized Shield
Faster Movement is removed, Faster Levitation is removed, Haste replaces both of these perks and combines them into one, providing a 60% movement speed boost in all directions per stack
Contact Damage now grants melee immunity
Sauvojen Tuntija now summons blackhole wands if it can't make line of sight with you for too long
Arrow Now longer has increased recoil
Relocated Friend Cave 1 & 2
Fixed Weakening Curse spells not showing remaining time on their effect and showing in the perk list instead of the status effect list
Fixed Chainsaw memory leak
Wandstone now lets you tinker just by holding it
Parrallel worlds are now harder to break into
Kantele Bomb Song is fixed
Chainsaw now costs 12 mana
Giga Death Cross now does much, much more damage
Weakening Curses now cause a target to take double damage instead of a flat 25% vulnerability against a certain damage type, the concept is in late game Noita, it's very easy to put projectile or explosive weakening curse on a wand and ignore all damage resistances enemies has, it doesn't force you to build wands outside of your comfort zone for certain environments and I feel it restricts wand creativity by allowing you, borderline making the best strategy to stick to one damage type, rather than needing to mix it up for endgame areas of the game. This change should also hopefully make weakening curses significantly more impactful in normal builds for optimising damage output than simply being a means to bypass damage resistances with little gain to overall damage output
Masters of Exchange no longer swap non-mortal entities (for example, cursed rock damage fields)
Low Recoil is replaced with No Recoil
Pit Boss now has a projectile failsafe incase it spawns too many wands (over 1k with high boss health multipliers)
Individual Enemies can now drop a maximum of 250k gold at any given time to prevent crashes in high NG+ runs (high NG+ runs usually become unplayable at a certain point otherwise if enemies start dying, flooding the screen with hundreds, sometimes thousands of gigantic physics objects)
