Healing Spells are uncopyable
Most enemies have significantly increased depending on their biome
Some creatures from late game biomes may have their attack speed increased
Most bosses have a minimum of 1000% extra health
Normal teleport bolts no longer spawn, however, alt-fire teleport bolts are significantly more common to compensate
Enemies spawn 1 NG+ level earlier (NG2 > NG1; NG1 > NG0; NG5 > NG4; etc)
