"New mod Apotheosis is out now!"
MoCreeps
Congas Cats
Remove _devtest from apotheosis_intro_cutscene for official release

Add Hints for how to activate portal via new method

Good thumbnail graphic for the mod workshop
Would like a nice border around it to make it look esteemed.
Title should be easy to see from a glance, but;
Most importantly it needs to stand out.

Remove ABBC anti-cheese after it goes to main
Remove Weakening Curse rework if weakening curse change goes to main build



Ending Desertchievement pillars
--Turned into a Sheep ending (failed apotheosis)
--Ascension ending (Succeeded apotheosis & became a god)
--Heretical takeover (Succeeded apotheosis.. but someone stole the reins from you, or you voluntarily handed him over)
(Would like Copi to cook something up for these similar to what he did for the other ones, but I fear he isn't long for this world) (Of Noita mod development over the upcoming few weeks)





How the hell is plane of mech going to work?
One giant mechanical worm boss fight inside a whole factory?
Killing it opens a portal to the exit portal
Could reuse most of Mechanical Worm for this, but make it significantly larger

Plane of magic is an endless battle ground
Go for a mystical garden feel?

Plane of nature is a jungle, relatively chill, introductory to the planes of gods.
Jungle you go through, no magical teleport/levitation powers
Just go find the exit
Maybe be shorter than the other planesas it's meant to introduce you to them?

100% playtest these, should accelerate development a ton, provide context for what needs to be worked on next.

Side note, ever since they were made, my head canon for Juvenile Centipede was they transcended to another plane of reality after maturing, they only come back to the world of Noita to lay new eggs.
