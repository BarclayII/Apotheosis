Would be good to have a corrupt version of Master of Puppetering for Temple of Sacriligious Remains, or maybe he's just corrupt by default
We'll have to see

Do something with Wand of Aiming

Fix "Custom Seed Successfully Set" appearing every run

Fix Seekers permanently stunning you to death with electric damage if they sit on top of you

Waterstone + Suffocatium = Permanent 0 oxygen glitch
If you're stained in suffocatium and pull out a waterstone for the breathless ability, you're glitched with never being able to regenerate your breath meter
What's Happening:
Copi's things lets the breathless effect occur in-inventory, for whatever reason, breathless disables natural breath regeneration (why nolla..????)
As a result, suffocatium doens't detect you have breathless via a water stone in your inventory and doesn't properly stop your breath being lowered.
How does it successfully apply breathless to the player, but fails to properly pick up the player has breathless? Bug in the function code?

Herobrine only spawns at 7pm to 5am (when it's dark outside)

Fix porings being off center
