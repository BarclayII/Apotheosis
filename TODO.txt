Remove Weakening Curse rework if weakening curse change goes to main build
Might be good to update the "summoning sigil" for divine light since everything else got reworked to look prettier, it feels almost out of place now, could rotate the sprite for a smoother visual effect?

Finish or Remove Spine Worm
Finish or Remove mini-heretics

"New mod Apotheosis is out now!"
MoCreeps
Congas Cats
Remove _devtest from apotheosis_intro_cutscene for official release

How the hell is plane of mech going to work?
One giant mechanical worm boss fight inside a whole factory?
Killing it opens a portal to the exit portal
Could reuse most of Mechanical Worm for this, but make it significantly larger

Plane of magic is an endless battle ground
Go for a mystical garden feel?

Plane of nature is a jungle, relatively chill, introductory to the planes of gods.
Jungle you go through, no magical teleport/levitation powers
Just go find the exit
Maybe be shorter than the other planesas it's meant to introduce you to them?

100% playtest these, should accelerate development a ton, provide context for what needs to be worked on next.

Side note, ever since they were made, my head canon for Juvenile Centipede was they transcended to another plane of reality after maturing, they only come back to the world of Noita to lay new eggs.
